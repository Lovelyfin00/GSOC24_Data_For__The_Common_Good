# Clinical Trial Form

This project is a demo of the code I submitted for the GSOC'24 project `Front-end and Adaptive Question Rendering` by Data for the common good. It's a React application that allows users to fill out a form related to cancer clinical trials. The form displays questions step by step based on the user's input, showing questions specific to males or females depending on their selection.
